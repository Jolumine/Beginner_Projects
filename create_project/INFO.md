# Project creator

This project is an automation to create the basic folder structure for python projects. <br>
It's is customizable and it uses command line arguments to specify the language you want to create a project for. <br>


## My usage 

I created a .exe file from it with auto-py-to-exe and added it to my PATH, <br> so I can access it from everywhere of my device.
